Lesson 3: Smart Choices – Risk Strategies That Work
By now, you understand how to recognize risk and measure how risky a situation is. But what do you actually do with that information? You manage it.
There are four main strategies used to manage risk effectively:
1. Risk Avoidance – You completely avoid the activity that brings the risk. For example, if investing in a startup feels too risky, you choose not to invest at all.
2. Risk Reduction – You take steps to lower the chance of the risk happening or reduce its impact. For instance, if you ride a bike, wearing a helmet reduces the risk of injury.
3. Risk Transfer – You shift the risk to someone else. This is what insurance does—if your phone breaks, the insurance company covers the cost, not you.
4. Risk Retention – You accept the risk and deal with the consequences. Maybe you decide not to buy insurance and take your chances. Sometimes this is the cheapest option, especially for smaller risks.
Knowing which strategy to use—and when—is what makes someone good at managing risk. This lesson helps you identify these strategies in real-life situations.
