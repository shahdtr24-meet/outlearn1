Complete skill- opportunity cost
Lesson 1: The Basics – Every Choice Has a Cost
Explanation:
 You make choices all the time. What to eat, what to do, where to go.
 But have you ever thought about what you're giving up every time you choose something?
That’s what opportunity cost is all about:
 It’s the thing you didn’t choose — the second-best option you had.
It might be time with friends, money you could’ve saved, or something fun you passed up.
Once you see it, you can start making better choices.

Lesson 2: Everyday Trade-Offs – What You’re Really Giving Up
Explanation:
 It’s not just big decisions — small ones matter too.
 When you spend your money, your time, or your energy, you're always giving something up in return.
Every “yes” to one thing is a “no” to something else.
 And that “no” is your opportunity cost.
This lesson will help you spot those trade-offs in real-life situations — like choosing between spending now or saving, relaxing or learning, fun or future goals.
The more aware you are of what you’re passing up, the smarter your choices will be.

Lesson 3: Smart Thinking – Why It Matters
Explanation:
 By now, you know that every choice has a cost — not just in money, but in time, energy, and missed experiences.
 So why does opportunity cost really matter?
Because in real life, you’ll face choices that shape your future:
Should I work or study?


Should I relax or get ahead?


Should I focus on experience or enjoyment?


You can’t do everything.
 And the smarter you are about what you're giving up, the more confident you’ll be in what you choose.
This lesson asks you to think about long-term value and what you might be giving up without realizing it.
